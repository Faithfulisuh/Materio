Here is the comprehensive plan for pushing to a new GitHub repository:

1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
   - Fill in the repository name, description, and choose whether it should be public or private.
   - Click "Create repository."

2. **Link Local Repository to GitHub**:
   - In your terminal, add the new GitHub repository as a remote to your local repository using the command:
     ```
     git remote add origin <repository-url>
     ```
   - Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the newly created GitHub repository.

3. **Add and Commit Changes**:
   - Stage your changes with:
     ```
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the changes with a message:
     ```
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

4. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push your local repository to GitHub using:
     ```
     git push -u origin master
     ```

5. **Verify the Push**:
   - Go back to your GitHub repository in the browser and refresh the page to see your files.
